## General Information
Simple personal web portfolio written in HTML5 and CSS based on the following template shown in [Youtube](https://youtu.be/AKNvTxWOdKw).

That portfolio includes almost everything you want to show. At first, your name, links to social networks and a great image. 
Then the About section displays more information about you. Then the list of Skills it offers. It also has a section where 
it shows some recent work. And at the bottom it has a form, and at the end with a footer.


## Technologies Used

- CSS
- Heroku 7.59.1
